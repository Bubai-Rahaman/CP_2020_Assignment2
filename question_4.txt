1. What are stiff differential equations?
Ans: Stif differential equation are those whose exact solutionhas a term of the form 
exp(-c*t), where c is a large positive constant. This is only a part of solution, called the transient solution. Other part of the solution is called steady-state solution.

2. Example: a) Transient responce of electrical circuit(charging or discharging of capacitor).
			b) Spring mass system.

3. Method: Backward euler integration method

4. scipy function:
	a) scipy.integrate.solve_ivp(fun,t_span,y0, method = 'Radau')
	b) scipy.integrate.solve_ivp(fun,t_span,y0, method = 'BDF')
